## 3. Analysis

In this folder, you can find the code for the actual analyses of my study.

- translated_lit.ipynb shows descriptive statistics and table outputs of the translated novels, as well as statistical tests for the simpson's diversity index 

- suomi_ylirajaisuus.ipynb contains code for analysing the nationalities of authors writing in Finnish (a bit messy code, the script is not tidied up)

- suomimuu.ipynb was used to query all novels written by Finnish authors in **other languages**.
